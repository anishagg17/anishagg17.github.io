          Anish is a Software Developer at Amazon with experience in collaborating with cross-functional teams, adapting to different technologies, and handling projects from start to finish. He has interned at LinkedIn, Amazon, and ElasticSearch, and has a strong CGPA of 9.01/10.
        </p>
        <p>
          His open source work at Elasticsearch https://github.com/elastic/eui/issues/3057 impressed me with the way he engaged with not only his mentor but also other developers & designers from the beginning to the completion of his project. His discussions regarding the approaches/frameworks/libraries for the project are backed by trade-offs which is a very effective way to communicate the available options.
        </p>
